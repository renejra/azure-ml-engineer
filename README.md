# azure-ml-engineer
Repository for my project work of Udacity's Azure ML Engineer nanodegree. In this repository you will find:

- Capstone Project: [Using Azure ML in Bitcoin trading](capstone/)
- Project 1: [Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure](project-1/)
- Project 2: [Operationalizing Machine Learning](project-2/)

Contents of `starter-files` are Udacity's authorship. I add these either to complete code-along exercises or 
start as boilerplate for some of the above mentioned projects.
